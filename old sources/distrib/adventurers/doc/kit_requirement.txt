Monk
Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own. They channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.

20th level: Immune to non-magical weapons. 
Disadvantages: 

The monk cannot wear armor. 
A monk can only use weapons available to the thief class (except two-handed).
Sorcerer
Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than wizards, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way wizards do. Other than these differences, a sorcerer is very similar to the wizard.

Note: A sorcerer does NOT learn spells from scrolls. He chooses new spells with each level. A sorcerer's prime requisite in BG2 is INTELLIGENCE.
